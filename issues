- After several layers, the numbers becomes too small.
- One reason is padding and getting mean.
- Another idea for q,k,v values is to get the mean of their previous tokens for each q,k,v separately.
- Add overall score for layers along with checking vector values to check gradient vanishing.
- pre LN works better with the group head.
- Let's try layer-wise learning rate
